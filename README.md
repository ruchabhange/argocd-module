# ArgoCD Level-02
## Disaster Recovery (40 Minutes)
Argocd data are stored in the kubernetes custer one should consider taking backup of the argocd data regularly to avoid downtime and outages. Argocd configuration export can be done per individual application or by just exporting all of the applications to a YAML file.
It is generally recommended to store the applications individually and within the same git repository that the Kubernetes objects are defined so that they will be under revision control and available in the event of a disaster.

##### Assignment(20 Minutes)
:computer: Backup and Restore [Helm-guestbook](https://github.com/rajatrj16/argocd-example-apps/tree/main/helm-guestbook) application by exporting backup files created using argocd command line tool.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary></br>
backup:

```yaml
argocd app get argocd/helm-guestbook -o yaml > simple-app-backup.yaml
  ```

 _Delete the existing application_ or _deploy the application in another cluster_

restore:

```yaml
argocd app create -f simple-app-backup.yaml
```

## 07-Argocd with Kustomize (60 minutes)

Kustomize traverses a Kubernetes manifest to add, remove or update configuration options without forking. It is available both as a standalone binary and as a native feature of kubectl (and by extension oc)
- [Read][Kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/guides/introduction/kustomize/)
- [Read][kustomize-argocd](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/kustomize/)

##### Kustomized Application:</br>

Argo CD has native support for Kustomize. You can use this to avoid duplicating YAML for each deployment. This is especially good to use if you have different environments or clusters youâ€™re deploying to.


##### Hands-on activity (30 minutes)</br>
:computer: This is sample k8s application [repo](https://github.com/shehbaz-pathan/simple-microservices-app/tree/master/manifests) we have integrate with kustomize template with 2 enviornment and deploy the application to argocd with env changes as:
```
Test : replica count for customer-2 and web-frontend-3, nameSuffix-test, commonLabels: purpose-Argocd-demo , env-test
Prod : replica count for customer-3 and web-frontend-4 , nameprifix-prod, commonLabels: purpose-Argocd-demo , env-prod
```

 Pre-Requsite:
 
1 kustomization installed 

2 use concept of an "overlay", where you have a "base" set of manifests and you overlay your kustomizations for test and stage enviornment.

Step1: Make 2 directory base with apllication manifest and kustomization.yaml for base application to pick up the k8 manifest as:
dir: base/kustomization.yaml

```yaml
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - web-frontend.yaml
  - customers.yaml 
commonLabels:
  purpose: Argocd-demo
 
  ```

Step2: For test enviornment kustomization template with required enviornment dir overlays/test/kustomization.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

bases:
  - ../../base

commonLabels:
  purpose: Argocd-demo
  env : test

nameSuffix: -test

replicas:
  - name: web-frontend
    count: 2
  - name: customers-v2
    count: 3

  ```

Test the test enviornment is working properly by kustomization build and apply to cluster command: `kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -` from directory 
`/overlays/test/kustomization` with required configuration

Step 3 : For Prod enviornment kustomization template with required enviornment dir overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

bases:
  - ../../base

commonLabels:
  env : prod

nameSuffix: -test

replicas:
  - name: web-frontend
    count: 3
  - name: customers-v2
    count: 4
  ```

Test the prod enviornmenttemplate is working properly by kustomization build and apply to cluster command: `kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -` from directory `/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml` with required configuration
