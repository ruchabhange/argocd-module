## 07-Argocd with Kustomize (60 minutes)

Kustomize traverses a Kubernetes manifest to add, remove or update configuration options without forking. It is available both as a standalone binary and as a native feature of kubectl (and by extension oc)
- [Read][Kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/guides/introduction/kustomize/)
- [Read][kustomize-argocd](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/kustomize/)

##### Kustomized Application:</br>

Argo CD has native support for Kustomize. You can use this to avoid duplicating YAML for each deployment. This is especially good to use if you have different environments or clusters youâ€™re deploying to.


##### Hands-on activity (30 minutes)</br>
:computer: This is sample k8s application [repo](https://github.com/shehbaz-pathan/simple-microservices-app/tree/master/manifests) we have integrate with kustomize template with 2 enviornment and deploy the application to argocd with env changes as:
```
Test : replica count for customer-2 and web-frontend-3, nameSuffix-test, commonLabels: purpose-Argocd-demo , env-test
Prod : replica count for customer-3 and web-frontend-4 , nameprifix-prod, commonLabels: purpose-Argocd-demo , env-prod
```

 Pre-Requsite:
 
1 kustomization installed 

2 use concept of an "overlay", where you have a "base" set of manifests and you overlay your kustomizations for test and stage enviornment.

Step1: Make 2 directory base with apllication manifest and kustomization.yaml for base application to pick up the k8 manifest as:
dir: base/kustomization.yaml

```yaml
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - web-frontend.yaml
  - customers.yaml 
commonLabels:
  purpose: Argocd-demo
 
  ```

Step2: For test enviornment kustomization template with required enviornment dir overlays/test/kustomization.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

bases:
  - ../../base

commonLabels:
  purpose: Argocd-demo
  env : test

nameSuffix: -test

replicas:
  - name: web-frontend
    count: 2
  - name: customers-v2
    count: 3

  ```

Test the test enviornment is working properly by kustomization build and apply to cluster command: `kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -` from directory 
`/overlays/test/kustomization` with required configuration

Step 3 : For Prod enviornment kustomization template with required enviornment dir overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

bases:
  - ../../base

commonLabels:
  env : prod

nameSuffix: -test

replicas:
  - name: web-frontend
    count: 3
  - name: customers-v2
    count: 4
  ```

Test the prod enviornmenttemplate is working properly by kustomization build and apply to cluster command: `kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -` from directory `/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml` with required configuration

# ArgoCD Level-02
## User Management(60 Minutes)
### a) Local Users/Accounts(20 Minutes)
ArgoCD allows us to create to local users/accounts for authenticating and authorizing the different users and groups and restrict access to the ArgoCD and its resources. Argo CD does not have its own user management system and has only one built-in user admin. The admin user is a superuser and it has unrestricted access to the system. ArgoCD allows restrict access to ArgoCD resources using RBAC permissions.

- [Read][RBAC Rules](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#rbac-configuration)

### b) SSO(40 Minutes)
ArgoCD allows us to integrate SSO to use our existing identity provider to access ArgoCD resources, since we already know ArgoCD don't its own user management system but allow us to restrict access to its resource using RBAC permissions so we can use our existing identity provider for authenticating and RBAC permission for authorization.

## 03-ArgCD Sync Phases and Waves
Argo CD executes a sync operation in a number of steps. At a high-level, there are three phases pre-sync, sync and post-sync.

Within each phase you can have one or more waves, that allows you to ensure certain resources are healthy before subsequent resources are synced.
